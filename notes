# Angular 8 Application with PHP Back-End Example


Before started the angular project you must have installed Angular 8 in your system. If you dont have installed angular than you can install using below command:
npm install -g @angular/cli

I have uploaded all the source code without the node_modules folder. You need this folder to run angular project. Run below command for get node modules:
npm install 
it will install all the dependencies for your source code.
